## Note:
This solution includes code from library Docker.Registry.Dotnet, originally distributed at https://github.com/CaptiveAire/Docker.Registry.DotNet, which claims to be the original attempt at a Docker registry API package. 

HOWEVER: At the time of this writing that library does not build and does not appear to be actively maintained.  I used the fork at https://github.com/Zguy/Docker.Registry.DotNet.  My solution references that library project; that repo should be cloned to a sibling folder to this one.
