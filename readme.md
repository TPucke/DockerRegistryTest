## Note:
This solution includes code from library Docker.Registry.Dotnet, originally distributed at https://github.com/CaptiveAire/Docker.Registry.DotNet, which claims to be the original attempt at a Docker registry API package. 

HOWEVER: At the time of this writing that library does not build and does not appear to be actively maintained.  A good fork with a relatively small update appears to be https://github.com/Zguy/Docker.Registry.DotNet and this is the libary I have used.  My solution references that library project so that repo should be cloned to a sibling folder to this one.
